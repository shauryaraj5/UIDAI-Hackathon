### Problem Statement
> Imagine you belong to the capital city of India and you reside within IIT Delhi campus. You have just enrolled yourself to the aadhaar identity platform and after successful enrolment, you have received your letter containing the aadhaar number, demographics data such as name and address. Alas, in
the address field you see the repetition of ‚ÄòDelhi‚Äô multiple times, making the address a little convoluted. Like you, many of the residents especially those who are residing in
the urban areas see the repetition of the same content in the final address.

### üè† [API endpoint](https://uidai-address-handler.herokuapp.com/)

## Our Solution
* This API built by us will be used to remove unnecessary duplication of address fields and then identify the major fields like district, state and pincode and then reformat the address to have these fields at their rightful place.
* This will ensure the proper formatting and readability of the address mentioned on an individual`s Aadhar Card.
* Our API has support for multiple regionals languages, like Hindi,telugu,etc.

## Usage

* Send a post request at https://uidai-address-handler.herokuapp.com/
* Request body should contain raw input in JSON format.
* Following are vaild keys for JSON:
        "house": null,
        "building": null,
        "apartment": null,
        "street": null,
        "road": null,
        "lane": null,
        "area": null,
        "locality": null,
        "sector": null,
        "landmark": null,
        "village": null,
        "town": null,
        "city": null,
        "sub district": null,
        "district": null,
        "state": null,
        "pincode": null
* The response would have all the fields in correct sequence, captalisation and format, without any repetition.
* To get complete address use the last key of the response: ```formatted_address```

}
```
Future Implementations:
Increasing the accuracy and optimising the API! For every rule about addresses there are exceptions and edge cases to consider. More test cases are always needed.

Planned features:

Spell checker- For example ignore/rectify spellings of named Streets, Landmarks, VTC, District, State.
Address Cross Checker- Take the help of google map api to validate the addresses.
